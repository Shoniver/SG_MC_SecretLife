 Terms of Service:
  The plugin's code is public for all to see on GitHub mainly to help others start and learn.
  Do not, under any circumstance, reupload the plugin on any website.
  If you want to use parts of this code in your own projects, you ARE allowed to - but: 
  - I would like to ask you to credit me (Shoniver) for the parts you use.
  - Make sure your project is different and unique - not just this plugin but with subtle changes. That WILL be considered reuploading.
  And of course - never use the plugin for commercial use. It is made for you to play with and enjoy, not for making a profit.
  Thank you! :)
